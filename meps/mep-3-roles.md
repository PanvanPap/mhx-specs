# MEP 3: Roles
Different entities are not treated the same in this platform. From one
perspective, there are three categories are entities in the system:

- owners: the users/patients who are the owners of their data
- holders: the entities holding and storing the data, _e.g._ a hospital or
  an app platform
- sinks: the entities who request a specific data/dataset and receive them.
  For instance, a research institute, an insurance, or a pharma.


There needs to be a way to specify these roles for each ID, and these roles
would then make a difference when players of the game trigger different smart
contracts on the platform.
