# mhx-specs
This repository defines the technical specifications of [meHealthX
(mhx)](https://www.mehealthx.com/) network, along with the specifications of
required contracts, storage, ID management, etc.

The overview document is a place to start which keeps a high level overview of
the components, each defined in their relevant documents.

Each document is an enhancement proposal, i.e. it enhances the status quo. At
the starting the status quo starts as an empty set, and mhx enhancement
proposals (MEP) add to the previous status quo. This model is inspired by
[Python Enhancement Poposals (PEP)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/).
